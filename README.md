@Contributors: Sundoo, Chase, Trenton, Josh

## Project Background
- Despite the fact that most, if not all, businesses run their social media accounts these days, many people have raised a question of whether businesses actually benefit from using it or do nothing but damage themselves. Twitter is one of the most popular social media channels. Companies use it, hoping that it will bring them huge love and popularity among users in some way. Yet, more often than not, customers take advantage of businesses' Twitter accounts as a window to complain about products, services, employees, store management, new menu, etc. It will be interesting to see whether selected businesses' Twitter accounts are being used to affect the businesses in a positive or a negative way.


## Questions/Requirements
- Select well-known businesses' Twitter accounts
- Use Twitter API to access their stream and historical data
- Go over their tweets/retweets and categorize each tweet/retweet either as positive or as negatve, based on the nuanced words used (Use Apache Spark)
- Answer the question: Which companies' Twitter accounts have more positive tweets/retweets than negative ones? and vice-versa? What is the insight gained from analyzing these businesses' Twitter content?
